# Object-Detection-Using-OpenCV-Python
The Program is made by coupling object detection and face detection using OpenCV
The program aims at two things:-
  1. Detecting the introduction of any new object in the frame of the webcam by comparing present image with the initial image i.e. when webcam started.
  2. If the detected object has a face, then his/her face shall be saved as shown in the images. (This uses Haar Cascade Classifier for detecting faces)
